One of my prefered electronic youtuber is w2aew (https://www.youtube.com/@w2aew) and this
circuit is from his video named :
 #281: Bipolar Transistor Switching Time Measurement
 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgSKLsWAWGs&ab_channel=w2aew)

A friend of mine gave me a lot of parts including transistors and I plan to use this
circuit to help me to test transistors as well those I buy either in China or at
specialised resellers... and to compare them...
